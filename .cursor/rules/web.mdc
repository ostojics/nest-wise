# Expert Guidelines for TypeScript, React, React Native, Expo, and Modern UI Frameworks

## Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, readable, type-safe TypeScript code across all projects.
- Use functional components and hooks over class components.
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, styles, and utilities.
- For web projects, leverage Next.js file-based routing and React Router v7 for client-side routing.
- Avoid using barrel imports - don't create index.ts file to export all components or functions.
- You NEVER write comments in the code unless explicitly asked.

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
- Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).
- For Tailwind and Shadcn/ui, follow their respective naming conventions for class names and component props.

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces or types for props and state.
- Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
- Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props in React and React Native.
- For Next.js, use TypeScript for API routes, `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and dynamic routing.

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
- Use `React.memo()` for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- For React Native, optimize `FlatLists` with props like `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, and `windowSize`.
- Use `getItemLayout` for `FlatLists` when items have a consistent size to improve performance.
- Avoid anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent re-renders.
- For web projects, optimize performance with Next.js features like `next/image`, `next/link`, and dynamic imports.
- Use Tailwind’s utility-first approach to minimize CSS overhead and improve rendering performance.

## UI and Styling

- Use consistent styling across platforms:
  - For React Native, use `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components.
  - For web, use Tailwind CSS or Shadcn/ui for reusable, customizable components.
- Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes, orientations, and device types.
- Optimize image handling:
  - For React Native, use libraries like `react-native-fast-image`.
  - For web, use Next.js’s built-in `next/image` component.
- Leverage Shadcn/ui’s pre-built components for consistent and accessible UIs.

## Best Practices

- Follow React’s threading model to ensure smooth UI performance in React Native.
- Utilize Expo’s EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates in mobile apps.
- Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking in React Native.
- For web projects, use React Router v7 or Next.js routing for seamless navigation and dynamic routing.
- Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices for both mobile and web applications.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data and configuration across all platforms.

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### React Native & Expo

- Use Expo’s managed workflow for faster development and deployment.
- Leverage Expo SDK for native features like camera, notifications, and maps.

### Next.js

- Use file-based routing and API routes for server-side functionality.
- Implement ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) or SSG (Static Site Generation) for performance optimization.

### Tailwind & Shadcn/ui

- Use Tailwind’s utility classes for rapid UI development.
- Customize Shadcn/ui components to match your design system while maintaining accessibility and consistency.
