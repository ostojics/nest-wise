### Current Status

This documentation is being developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of production deployment scenarios. Check back for updates or contribute to the documentation effort.

### Quick Start (Development Only)

For immediate evaluation, you can use the development setup from the [Local Development Setup](setup.md) guide, but note that this is **not suitable for production use** due to:

- Development-only security settings
- Unencrypted database connections
- Debug logging enabled
- No SSL/TLS termination
- Development JWT secrets

### Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the self-hosting documentation or have specific deployment scenarios you'd like covered, please open an issue or pull request in the repository.
